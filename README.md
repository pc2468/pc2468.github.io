*"Since school days, I’ve been hooked on dazzling simulations of the universe — the kind that sneak you into adventures you never planned for and stretch your brain like an exothermic reaction, with curiosity as the catalyst. From freezing the night sky onto a camera sensor to wrestling with calculus (and learning to love it), I’ve tried to understand that love using bit-driven systems like Linux (I use Arch, btw), where Python and C do most of the heavy lifting."*
