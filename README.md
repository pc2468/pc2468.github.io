# Portfolio – pc2468

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website:  
[pc2468.github.io](https://pc2468.github.io)

Built with **Astro**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the site features modern animations, responsive design, and glassmorphism-inspired UI.

- **Responsive** – works across desktop, tablet, and mobile  
- **Custom Sections** – CV preview, research interests, events, and more  
- **Easy Deployment** – optimized for GitHub Pages
